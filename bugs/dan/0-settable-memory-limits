Okay.  I'll plan to make those limits (memory and time) settable in the configure script, eventually.

    Hello Dan,

    I figured out the cause of the problem:
    for some reasons starting 'pure' M2  already costs 974 Mb of virtual
    memory, and thus  "ulimit -v 850000; M2 ..." will fail.

    Unfortunately i have no knowledge about the linux virtual memory
    management and hence no idea how to solve this problem without
    incrementing the memory limit.
