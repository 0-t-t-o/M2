suggestion from Mike:

having all of the included packages integrated into our documentation would be
very good (especially having them all in the main index).

Also, I think there should be a semi-hand-crafted page which has all of the
packages divided up by section.  Perhaps with an "especially useful" section
too...

This last could be automated if we allow in the package header (or somewhere) a
Section option, where we have a specific selection of allowed values.  Those
that don't have one will go in an "Other" section.  Of course, there should
also be an alphabetical list still somewhere.
