-- Witness set for a projective variety 
-- (in fact subscheme of PP^n that may be neither irreducible nor non-reduced)
-- should store 
-- (1) a projective SlicingVariety S
-- (2) a finite collection of (W,toA,toP) where
--   W is a WSet in the corresponding affine chart w.r.t. toA(S) 
--   toA and toP are rational maps of dehomogenization and homogenization
