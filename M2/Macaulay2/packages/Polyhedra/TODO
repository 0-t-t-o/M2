generate polymake tests for:
*  hilbertBasis
*  minkowskiSum
*  normalFan
*  faceFan
*  toric variety things

Thoughts:
*  The faceBuilders should be completely removed.
*  The newMinkSum method should be removed.
*  The latticePoints method should be replaced by something better.
*  Sanitize input matrices at some point?
*  addCone should be completely be removed.
*  There are too many intersection methods.
