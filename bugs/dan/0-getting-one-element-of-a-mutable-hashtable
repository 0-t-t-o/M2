There is no way to get just one element of a mutable hash table whose keys are unknown,
because "select(1,x,i->true) requires x to be immutable.  Fix by relaxing that
requirement, or by doing something else.  We probably thought that requirement was
important for thread safety, but now we can use mutexes or something.
