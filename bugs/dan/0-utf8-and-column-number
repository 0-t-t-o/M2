i10 : {* 你好 *}   1    /   0
stdio:12:21:(3): error: division by zero
	 ^^
	 not the right column number


i6 : {* NH *}   1    /   0
stdio:7:17:(3): error: division by zero
	^^
	this is what it should have been


It's counting bytes instead of utf-8 characters.

i7 : ascii "你好"

o7 = {228, 189, 160, 229, 165, 189}

o7 : List


This could be a command line option, because there might be other encodings compatible with ascii.
