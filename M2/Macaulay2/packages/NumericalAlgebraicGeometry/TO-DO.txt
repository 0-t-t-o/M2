numericalIrreducibleDecomposition fails on a singular point: e.g., ideal(x_1^2,x_2^2,x_3^3)

movePoints should take a list of Points

deflation needs work

points WitnessSet -- should return list of Points not list of lists (check if external packages use it)

"isOn" is another version of "member"

decompose -- still not robust for nonreduced components
