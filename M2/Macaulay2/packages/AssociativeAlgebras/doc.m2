      "Defining a noncommutative ring"
   Description
      Text
         A noncommutative ring is a @ TO Ring @ of subclass @ TO FreeAlgebra @ or @ TO FreeAlgebraQuotient @.
      Text
         In addition to defining a ring as a quotient of a @ TO FreeAlgebra @, some common ways to create
	 noncommutative rings include @ TO skewPolynomialRing @ and @ TO oreExtension @.      
      
         Let's consider a three dimensional Sklyanin algebra.  We first define the free algebra on the
	 variables x,y,z:
      Example
         A = QQ{x,y,z}
      Text
         Then input the defining relations, and put them in an ideal:
      Example
	 f = y*z + z*y - x^2
	 g = x*z + z*x - y^2
	 h = z^2 - x*y - y*x
     	 I=ideal{f,g,h}
      Text
         Next, we will define the quotient ring (as well as try a few functions on this new ring).
	 Note that when the quotient ring is defined, Macaulay2 computes the Groebner basis
	 of I (out to a certain degree, should the Groebner basis be infinite).
      Example
	 B=A/I
	 generators B
	 numgens B
	 isCommutative B
	 coefficientRing B
      Text
	 As we can see, x is now an element of the quotient B.
      Example
         x
      Text
         If we define a new ring containing x, x is now part of that new ring.  For example,
	 we can use the following command to define the (-1)-skew polynomial ring on the
	 variables x,y,z,w:
      Example
      	 C = skewPolynomialRing(QQ,(-1)_QQ,{x,y,z,w}) 
         x
      Text
         We can 'go back' to B using the command @ TO (use, Ring) @.
      Example
	 use B
	 x
	 use C
      Text
         We can also create an Ore extension.  First define a @ TO RingMap @ with @ TO map @.
      Example
	 sigma = map(C,C,{y,z,w,x})
      Text
         Then call the command @ TO oreExtension @.
      Example
	 D = oreExtension(C,sigma,a)
	 generators D
	 numgens D

   Inputs

   Outputs
      : RingMap
   Description
      Text
         Let x be a homogeneous element in a noncommutative ring R. If x is normal then x determines
	 a graded ring automorphism f of R by x*a = f(x)*a.  This method returns this 
	 automorphism as a RingMap. 
      Example
         A = QQ{a,b,c}
	 I = ideal {a*b+b*a,a*c+c*a,b*c+c*b}
	 B = A/I
	 sigma = map(B,B,{b,c,a})
	 C = oreExtension(B,sigma,w)
      Text
         By construction, w is normal, and the normalizing automorphism is sigma
	 extended to C sending w to itself.  It follows that therefore w^2 is also
	 normal whose automorphism is the square of sigma extended to C in a similar
	 way.  We verify these facts with the following commands:
      Example
	 isNormal w^2        
	 phi = normalAutomorphism w^2
	 matrix phi
	 matrix (sigma * sigma)

   Description
      Text
         Let b_1,...,b_n be a monomial basis for a noncommutative Ring A in degree d. We assume A
	 is generated by elements a_1,...,a_k of degree 1. A homogeneous element r in A
	 is normal if a_i*r is in the span of the r*a_j for all i.
      Text
         Using the input symbols x and y, we define the "normal variety" to be the 
	 set of common solutions to the equations  
	 x_j*a_i*b_j = y_j1*b_j*a_1+...+y_jk*b_j*a_k 
	 for all i and j. Saturating the ideal at each x_i we extract polynomial equations
	 the x_i must satisfy for the element x_1*b_1+...+x_n*b_n to be normal in A.
      Text
         Before computing the normal variety, this method checks for normal monomials
	 in degree n. These are returned first to reduce the complexity of the problem.
	 Then the method computes the variety and returns its components. The equations
         the method returns are given in terms of the indexed variable x. The indices are
	 basis monomials in degree n.
      Text
         The following example is a 3-dimensional Sklyanin algebra.
      Example
	 B = threeDimSklyanin(QQ,{1,1,-1},{x,y,z})
	 ncBasis(2,B)
	 normalElements(B,2,r)
      Text
         The normal elements in degree 2 are x^2, y^2 and z^2. The basis
	 calculation shows y^2 and z^2 are normal forms in B. The normalElements
	 method first checks all basis monomials using @ TO isNormal @. In this case
	 it finds y^2 and z^2 are normal and returns this information. However,  
	 x^2 is not a normal form expression. The normal form of x^2 is y*z+z*y. In 
	 the second phase of the calculation, the method returns generators of the
	 ideal describing the normal elements (excluding the normal monomials). We
	 see the coefficients of basis monomials z*x and y*x must be 0 and the 
	 coefficients of y*z and z*y must be equal. These equations identify
	 x^2 = y*z+z*y as a normal element of degree 2.
      Example
         normalElements(B,3,t)
	 g = -y^3-z*y*x+y*z*x+z^3
	 isCentral g
      Text
         In degree 3, there are no normal monomials, so the first part of the return
	 value is the empty list.  The second coordinate of the return value is a single
	 matrix whose entries determine the equations that show that the only normal element
	 of degree 3 (up to scaling) is the central element g.

   Description
      Text 
         The AssociativeAlgebras package contains a number of methods for studying noncommutative
	 rings - primarily graded rings. The following three extended examples 
	 highlight the capabilites of the package. 
      Text
         Our first example concerns a three-dimensional Sklyanin algebra. This example is
	 a PI-ring. We define the ring as a quotient of the tensor algebra on three
	 generators by the two-sided ideal generated by the three elements listed.
      Example
         A = QQ{x,y,z}
      Text
         Users familiar with Macaulay2 will recognize the notation for a ring of
	 noncommutative polynomials is identical to that for local rings, see
	 @ TO (symbol SPACE, Ring, List) @. Thus the
	 previous line does not generate an error if you forget to load the @ TO AssociativeAlgebras @
	 package. 
      Example
	 f = y*z + z*y - x^2
	 g = x*z + z*x - y^2
	 h = z^2 - x*y - y*x
	 B = A/ideal{f,g,h}
      Text
         It is known that this algebra has a unique (up to rescaling) central element 
	 of degree 3. We can verify this claim computationally using @ TO centralElements @
	 and check that the element is regular to a given degree. See @ TO isLeftRegular @.
      Example
         centralElements(B,3)
	 j = z^3+y*z*x-z*y*x-y^3
	 isCentral j
	 apply(5,i->isLeftRegular(j,i+1))
      Text
         In fact, we can see that j is (up to scaling) the only normal element of degree 3.
	 See the discussion above for interpreting the output of @ TO normalElements @.
      Example
         normalElements(B,3,n)
	 ncBasis(3,B)
      Text
         The user can create noncommutative rings in ways other than specifying a
	 presentation. For our second example, consider a skew polynomial ring on four
	 generators, where generators skew-commute (but are not nilpotent). See
	 @ TO skewPolynomialRing @ for more details.
      Example
         C = skewPolynomialRing(QQ,(-1)_QQ,{x,y,z,w})
      Text
         Let us briefly note that the user can also define a skew polynomial ring 
	 with coefficients in a commutative ring.
      Example
         R = QQ[q]/ideal{q^4+q^3+q^2+q+1}
	 B = skewPolynomialRing(R,q,{x,y,z,w})
	 x*y == q*y*x         
      Text
         Returning to the main example, we can define a graded Ore extension of C 
	 by specifying an automorphism.
	 The function @ TO map @ is used to define a ring map. Note that ring maps 
	 are linear and multiplicative by definition but are not assumed to be  well-defined. 
      Example
         use C
         sigma = map(C,C,{y,z,w,x})
	   -- isWellDefined sigma
      Text
         We form the Ore extension of C by sigma. See @ TO oreExtension @.
      Example         
         D = oreExtension(C,sigma,a)
      Text
         The new generator a is normal and regular in D. Regularity (on the left or right)
	 can be checked one homogeneous degree at a time. See @ TO isLeftRegular @. 
	 Thus a determines a graded automorphism f:D->D via a*r=f(r)*a.
      Example
         isNormal a
	 apply(5,i-> isLeftRegular(a,i+1))
         sigmaD = normalAutomorphism a
      Text
	 Given an automorphism, one can check to see which elements it normalizes
	 in any given degree.
      Example       
         normalElements(sigmaD,1)
	 normalElements(sigmaD,2)
      Text
         One can check for the presence of normal elements more generally. In our
	 example, since a is normal, a^2 will also be normal. It is the only normal
	 monomial of degree 2. A complete description of the normal elements in a
	 given degree is given by @ TO normalElements @. 
      Example
         normalElements(D,2,P)
      Text
         Each component of the "normal variety" is a set of polynomial equations which must
	 be satisfied by the coefficients of the monomial basis for an element expressed
	 in that basis to be normal. In this case, the basis of D in degree 2 is
      Example
         ncBasis(2,D)	 
      Text
         The output of normalElements tells us that in order for a degree 2 element of D
	 to be normal, it must be an expression in powers of the generators, and that the
	 coefficients of these powers must satisfy the six nontrivial equations listed.
      Example
         isNormal (x^2+z^2-y^2-w^2)	 
      Text
         Of course, one has been able to define (graded) commutative algebras in Macaulay2 for
	 a long time.  Specifying graded commutativity is usually done with the
	 @ TO SkewCommutative @ option when creating the ring.  The user can convert such rings (and

   Description
      Text
         The quadratic closure of an ideal in a FreeAlgebra is the ideal
	 generated by the generators of I of degree at most 2.  Commonly used with 
	 @ TO homogDual @ in the case where the ideal generators are homogeneous of

         These methods return a matrix over the coefficient ring of the noncommutative ring to which r

	 the user will enter the ring element (required to be homogeneous) and a degree n.
	 The result is the matrix of the map A_n -> A_n+d where d is the degree of r.
	 The matrix is computed relative to the monomial basis obtain using 
	 @ TO (ncBasis, ZZ, Ring) @. 
	 
	 Alternatively, the user can enter sets of independent monomials to serve as a
	 basis for the domain and co-domain of the maps. The method left or right 
	 multiplies r by the fromBasis and converts to coordinates via @ TO coefficients @
	 and the toBasis.

	 If either list is not the appropriate length, then an error is thrown.  The generic

	 DegreeLimit may be provided to limit the maximum of a generator of a Groebner basis

	 condition given below) is chosen.
      
      	 In order to not get a degenerate example, one should ensure that the
	 parameters provided satisfy \alpha + \beta + \gamma + \alpha\beta\gamma = 0.
	 This method does not check this condition, since the degenerate examples are
	 of interest as well.  If no parameters are provided, however a generic choice
	 of \alpha,\beta and \gamma satisfying the equation above are selected.
