Todo for branch res-2018, created 9 March 2018.

1. Allow FastNonminimal resolutions to assume we have the GB.

2. Allow these to work with multi-gradings, as well as inhomogenoeus.

3. stash the nonminimal res, in a different location. What functions actually use nonminimal resolutions.

4. allow QQ as an actual coefficient ring.  Actually, allow any
  coefficient ring, as long as we are given a monic Groebner basis for
  it.
  
5. modules are not working correctly: there is a mismatch of monomial orders.  How best to fix this?

6. nonminimal --> minimal resolution.  How best to do this?  e.g. use zig-zag idea of Frank?

7. fix NonminimalComplexes package.

8. schreyerName functionality, in the engine?
