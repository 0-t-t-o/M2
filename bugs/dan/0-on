"on" should do something for all methods of a method function, 
like this:

on2 = f -> scan(methods f, m -> (
	  installMethod append ( m , on( lookup m, Name => "method for " | toString m#0 | " " | toString unsequence drop(m,1)));
	  ))

It should treat method functions with options properly, digging
in one level deeper.
