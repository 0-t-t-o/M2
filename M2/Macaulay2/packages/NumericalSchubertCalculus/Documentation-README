Functions that are used to see Exported vs. not Exported

---- NumericalSchubertCalculus.m2 ----

=== Exported ===
"setVerboseLevel", --function to change the amount of information printed on screen while running (levels 0,1,or 2)
"NSC'DBG", 
"NSC'VERIFY'SOLUTIONS", 
"NSC'BLACKBOX", 
"setFlags",
solveSchubertProblem
			---uses homotopies of the Geometrical LR-rule to solve Schubert problems on a Grassmannian

=== Not Exported ===
redChkrPos 
				-- given two partitions, computes the positions of the red checkers in the board
moveRed  
				-- makes the move of the red checkers during a game
moveCheckers 
				-- makes the next move of black and red checkers during a game
playCheckers 
				-- given two partitions, plays the combinatorial checkerboard game and outputs the hashtable of the checkermoves played
        -- it is also called recursively to play the next game of the Tournament and creates the Hashtable

makeLocalCoordinates
				-- translates a checkerboard into a matrix with 0s,1s, and variables

toRawSolutions
				-- takes solutions as nxk matrices and writes a list of values that 
						match with the variables of the local coordinates coordX in the 
						checkerboard variety (mainly used for writing solutions for the homotopy functions)

changeFlags


--   changeFlags  -- better name?

=== Protected Variables ===

Board  -- pair of arrays describing the checkerboard game: [positions.blackCheckers, positions.redCheckers]
IsResolved -- Flag to know if a specific node in the checkerboard game is already resolved or not (values only true or false)
Fathers  -- HashTable with the information of the previous checkerboard game in the tournament
Children  -- HashTable with the information of the next checkerboard game
FlagM  -- local coordinates of the moving flag at a specific internal node inside a game
CriticalRow  -- the row/column that is moving at the current internal node inside a game
Solutions  -- the solutions of the checkerboard variety w.r.t. the local coordinates
SolutionsSuperset -- (temporary) the solutions of the checkerboard variety w.r.t. local coordinates, computed with the BlackBox Solver

-- NC means no checker in that column
NC = infinity

-- OUR working FIELD
FFF = CC
--FFF = CC_53

ERROR'TOLERANCE = 0.001
NEWTON'TOLERANCE = 10^-10

------------------
-- Debug Level --
------------------
-- 0 = no debug mode
-- 1 = print progress info and time main processes
-- 2 = ... + checkerboard steps info
-- >2 = new experimental stuff kicks in
DBG = 1
VERIFY'SOLUTIONS = true 
BLACKBOX = false
