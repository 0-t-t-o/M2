Mike's Macaulay2 project list

1. Bug fixes
  currently: 
    0-fmoore-quotientBug-jan2013.m2
  and gb over ZZ issues:
    00-bug-gbZZ13.m2
    ~/src/M2-git/M2/Macaulay2/packages/Macaulay2Doc/test/slow/gbZZbug3-a.m2

2. Free resolutions and complexes
  a. prune of a non-minimal resolution (or complex?)
  b. more operations on complexes
    e.g.: take code from workshops (Chris and Jason code?)
    try out Spectral sequence code when they are ready
    connecting homomorphisms, etc.
  c. exterior power, etc. of a complex.

3. Primary Decomposition (with F. Hinkelmann, F. Moore)

4. Non-commutative GB's
  talk with Frank Moore, Colin, Toby Stafford, make a wishlist of what is desired,
  AND example computations.

5. improve saturations

6. improve elimination

7. improve GB over a field

8. improve GB over ZZ

9. tower rings.  Includes factorization over extension towers.

10. integral closure

11. Better linear algebra:
11A: over finite fields
11B: over RRR, CCC

12. Connect Bjarke's code

13. Try out and use the parallel stuff that Bill added:
  memory usage: really want each thread to not interfere here
  several algorithms at once: choose best.

14. Use mathic and memtailor when possible

15. connect flint
  MAKE PROGRAMMER POST!!

16. tryM2  (F. Hinkelmann and L. Kastner)

17. Workshop organization
  Frank Moore, Dave Swinarski, Sonja Mapes: Aug 2013 or Jan 2014.
  Hiro Abo and Zach Teitler: 2014?
  scientific meeting: Aug 2014 where?  Who will help organize that?
