Goals:
(W) implement (more orderly) data types representing (equidimensional) components of varieties
(M) support multiprojective geometry
(D) robustness for the nonreduced case

(W) is about various witness sets, here are the proposed types:
    * WSet should layout a framework of methods ("primitives") that are used by higher level algorithms 
    * PWSet, a projective witness set. Same for a component of a projective variety.
      	    * PWSet should link to one or several WSets, witness sets in particular affine charts
	    * A user option "Projectivize" should force an answer to an affine problem to be accompanied by an answer to its projectivization.
    * MPWSet should represent a component of a multiprojective variety.
      	     * Should it be a "collection of witness sets"?... or "collection" should be its own type?
    * is MWSet, the specialization to a particular set or affine charts, necessary?
    * ProxyWSet should represent an image of a rational map.
    
(D) for deflation.
    * deflation of an isolated point.
    * deflation of a positive-dimensional variety: the output should be expressed in terms of ProxyWSet. 
    * should we attach a "multiplicity structure"? (e.g., expressed in terms of an inverse system, via a DualSpace, etc.)
