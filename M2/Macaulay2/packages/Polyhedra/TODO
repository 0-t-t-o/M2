rays has weird definition
saveSession in own file?
polar is now defined via dual of underlyingCone. Will this fail for having linealitySpace?

generate polymake tests for:
*  hilbertBasis
*  minkowskiSum (this used to ignore the lineality space completely?)
*  normalFan
*  faceFan
*  toric variety things

Thoughts:
*  The faceBuilders should be completely removed.
*  The newMinkSum method should be removed.
*  The latticePoints method should be replaced by something better.
*  Sanitize input matrices at some point?
*  addCone should be completely be removed.
*  There are too many intersection methods.
*  Completeness of fans is probably very expensive to check at the moment.
*  What is a better naming scheme for the properties? Should we adapt the
   polymake scheme?
*  minkowSki sum potentially checks equality of polyhedra? This seems super
   expensive.

Packages that use Polyhedra:
[lars@sunfish packages]$ grep -R "Polyhedra" . | grep needsPackage
./MonomialAlgebras.m2:needsPackage "Polyhedra"
./Polyhedra2.m2:needsPackage "PolyhedralObjects"
./SRdeformations.m2:needsPackage "Polyhedra"
./LatticePolytopes.m2:needsPackage "Polyhedra"
./supplanted-packages/Polyhedra.m2:     F << "needsPackage \"Polyhedra\"" << endl;
./Macaulay2Doc/test/schenck-book-2.m2:needsPackage "Polyhedra"

Packages that should go away:
*  PolyhedralObjects.m2
*  Polyhedra2.m2
*  gfanInterface.m2 or gfanInterface2.m2
*  polymake.m2 or polymakeInterface.m2

Undocumented methods, that have been removed:
*  newMinkSum: No reference for algorithm given and too long to fix.
*  dualCayley, dualCayleyFace: Not documented at all, never tested.
