Ollie: It would be great to have a separate file(s) for subduction/sagbi related functions.
       Currently, service-functions.m2 is getting very crowded and contains many levels of functions:
       E.g. updateComputation passes off to one of three different functions.
       There are at least two ways to solve this:
       1) Have functions that do similar things in one file, such as the four update-related functions above
       2) Have functions on a similar level in one file, such as updateComputation in a higher-level file than what it calls
          We already do this for sagbi, since it sits in one file and calls stuff in service-functions.m2
