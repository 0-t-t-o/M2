Mike's Macaulay2 project list

1. Bug fixes
  currently: 
    0-fmoore-quotientBug-jan2013.m2
  and gb over ZZ issues:
    00-bug-gbZZ13.m2
    ~/src/M2-git/M2/Macaulay2/packages/Macaulay2Doc/test/slow/gbZZbug3-a.m2

2. Free resolutions and complexes
  a. prune of a non-minimal resolution (or complex?)
  b. more operations on complexes
    e.g.: take code from workshops (Chris and Jason code?)
    try out Spectral sequence code when they are ready
    connecting homomorphisms, etc.
  c. exterior power, etc. of a complex.

  Talked to Jason McCullough about this.  He says go ahead.
  code is in M2-development/msri2010: ExtFunctor, Functoriality
  I have placed a package called HomologicalAlgebra into packages.
    But what should we call it?
    It should be pre-loaded anyway.

3. Primary Decomposition (with F. Hinkelmann, F. Moore)

4. Non-commutative GB's
  talk with Frank Moore, Colin, Toby Stafford, make a wishlist of what is desired,
  AND example computations.

  Frank has a package: in WFU workshop, NCAlgebra.m2
5. improve saturations

6. improve elimination

7. improve GB over a field

8. improve GB over ZZ

9. tower rings.  Includes factorization over extension towers.

10. integral closure

11. Better linear algebra:

  11A: over finite fields.  With Jakob

  11B: over RRR, CCC.  With Anton.

12. Connect Bjarke's code to M2

13. Try out and use the parallel stuff that Bill added:
  memory usage: really want each thread to not interfere here
  several algorithms at once: choose best.

14. Use mathic and memtailor when possible

15. connect flint
  MAKE PROGRAMMER POST!!

16. tryM2  (F. Hinkelmann and L. Kastner)

17. Workshop organization
  Frank Moore, Dave Swinarski, Sonja Mapes: Aug 2013 or Jan 2014.
    looks like one will be in Aug 2013 at Cornell.
  Hiro Abo and Zach Teitler: 2014?
  scientific meeting: Aug 2014 where?  Who will help organize that?
