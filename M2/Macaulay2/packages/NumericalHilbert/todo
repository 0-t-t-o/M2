* Clarify paper around 6.9-6.10 (witness poly)
* isPointEmbedded
* isComponentEmbedded (for dim > 0)
* paper: polish the proofs for slicing down to dim 0
* isPointEmbeddedInCurve
* straighten out appendix (Jon?)
* isWitnessPolynomial cutoff. How should it interact with (d,d')?
  (a) prove that for every d' there exist d such that the test succeeds for random(d',Jdd) with probability 1
  (b) "remember" witness candidates for every (d',e) and check for each
