TO DO List

* Basic Functions
 * Constructors (parsing non-HR formats) (Tim)
 * Print complexes with labels, i.e. 1->A+B, 2->C+2D,...   (Chill)
 * (maybe) Higher level service functions (elimination, etc)
 * Accessors for Laplacian, other features (Tim)


* Examples
 * Add WNT Shuttle Model (from Elizabeth's Talk) (Chill)
 * Are there other models to add?
 * Examples of solving CRN eqns (all)
 * Elimination, degeneration
 * High-dimensional solution varieties
 * Examples using mondromy technique, mixed volumes 

* Operations
 * Removing vs eliminating for rxns/comps/species?
 * Removing species? 
 * Other manips? What do they mean?

* Equations
 * Options for parameters: random values, etc 
 * Observed variables (don't remember what this means, ask E)

* Higher level 
 * Multistationarity
 * Siphons

* Finishing Touches?
 * Documentation
