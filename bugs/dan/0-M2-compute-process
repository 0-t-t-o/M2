now that dumpdata/loaddata no longer work anywhere, we might replace it
as follows:

   start an M2 process and pause waiting for messages over a pair of pipes
   accept a start message and fork
   	in the child accept further command line arguments and
	process them, returning the output, exiting when done
   repeat
