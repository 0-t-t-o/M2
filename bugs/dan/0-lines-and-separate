The behavior of "lines" conflicts with its documentation:

i46 : lines "asdf\r\nasf"

o46 = {asdf, asf}

o46 : List

i47 : help lines

o47 = lines -- split a string into lines
      **********************************

...

      The form lines s is designed to break lines correctly when the file follows the Unix, MS-DOS, or Macintosh convention and contains no extraneous
      isolated newline or return characters.  In other words, it will break a line at "\r\n", "\n", or "\r".

o47 : DIV
