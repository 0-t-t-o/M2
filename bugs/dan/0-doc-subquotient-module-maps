To specify a map M-->M' of subquotient modules in the form map(M', M, m) it
seems the matrix m should go from

source generators M == cover M
to
source generators M' == cover M'

This is reasonable -- even "obvious", but it would have saved me a little time
had it been mentioned in the documentation.
