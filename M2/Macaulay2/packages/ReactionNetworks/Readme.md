TO DO List

October 2016

* Create isInjective function
* Create reactionMatrix function
* Fix laplacian function
* Create A matrix
* Can we have random, user, and parameter kk's and cc's?
* Can we group the kk's with the xx's, i.e. make them variables?
* Create examples that demonstrate how to treat the cc's and kk's
* Create several examples not within documentation but as
stand-alone.
* Update documentation and add new functions





* Basic Functions
 * Constructors (parsing non-HR formats) (Tim)
 * Print complexes with labels, i.e. 1->A+B, 2->C+2D,...   (Chill)
 * (maybe) Higher level service functions (elimination, etc)
 * Accessors for Laplacian, other features (Tim)


* Examples
 * Add WNT Shuttle Model (from Elizabeth's Talk) (Chill)
 * Are there other models to add?
 * Examples of solving CRN eqns (all)
 * Elimination, degeneration
 * High-dimensional solution varieties
 * Examples using mondromy technique, mixed volumes 

* Operations
 * Removing vs eliminating for rxns/comps/species?
 * Removing species? 
 * Other manips? What do they mean?

* Equations
 * Options for parameters: random values, etc 
 * Observed variables (don't remember what this means, ask E)

* Higher level 
 * Multistationarity
 * Siphons

* Finishing Touches?
 * Documentation
