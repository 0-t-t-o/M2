For quotientRemainder(Matrix,Matrix) and quotient(Matrix,Matrix), if the
source of the first map is not free, the resulting quotient may not be well-defined.

Think about the meaning of this, mathematically, and decide what to do.

Currently Matrix % Matrix requires free modules, inconsistently with quotientRemainder.
