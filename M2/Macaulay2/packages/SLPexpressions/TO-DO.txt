-- Decouple NAGtypes and SLPexpressions
the only problem is: who exports "evaluate"? 

-- What slows us down?
not cataloging all gates?
create several examples of large circuits (1-10 sec to setup)

-- Circuit creation
gatePolynomial -- currently, has a naive algorithm to produce a circuit for a poly
gatePolynomial(Strategy=>"optimal evaluation of the support monomials")
gatePolynomial(Strategy=>"Horner")
gateMatrix {list of polynomials}
diff -- has to be provided for any type of Gate

-- Gates of the future
analytic gates (cos, sin, exp)
"many-to-many" gates
constant gates of non-number type (pi, algebraic numbers, described by a subroutine, ...)

-- Naming questions
evaluate vs value -- value is not used much (rename?)
sub vs compose -- could sub be more general?
