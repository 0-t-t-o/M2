The list of dependencies is this:

AC_SUBST(PROGLIST, "4ti2 gfan normaliz nauty cddplus lrslib")

(see the current version of configure.ac)

For gentoo and other distributions that like external programs to be separate packages,
we should ensure that the configure script actually looks for the programs, instead of
automatically building all of them.
